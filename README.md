If you're here early, welcome!

I'm developing a sequel to Sensory Bridge that uses the dual-core ESP32-S3, but I've found so many major optimizations that I expect I could backport all of this to Sensory Bridge with a few weeks' work! Stay tuned. <3

#Updates from @larryqiann

I have added some instructions below on how to get the upstream project working on custom hardware:
https://github.com/Lixie-Labs/Emotiscope/issues/75#issue-2246706097

For now, this fork will be used to contain the hardware specific changes for my personal installation. Please note that it may not be the most applicable to your use case.
